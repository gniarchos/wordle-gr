# :game_die: Wordle - Greek Edition

This project was made using React. The words list was taken from [Scrabble Games](https://sites.google.com/site/dimizaro/lexiko/lexeis5grammaton).

##  :video_game: How to play

The goal of the game is to guess the word within six tries. Each guess should be a valid five-letter word. Hit the ENTER button to submit your guess. After each guess the color of the tiles will change to indicate how close your guess was to the answer.
